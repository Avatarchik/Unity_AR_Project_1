# Unity_AR_Project_1
First AR project created with Unity, Visual Studio, and Vuforia

Pictures uploaded to the Vuforia database can be used as image targets in a Unity project, for this project I use two image targets. 

The first is a Regal gift card. When my smartphone camera recognized this image target it will display a 3D house on
top of the Regal gift card.

The second is a maze I printed. When my smartphone camera recognized this image target it will make the maze appear 3D
by displaying walls on top of the black lines in the image and will spawn a blue ball onto the maze, allowing you to 
try getting the ball through the maze by moving the piece of paper around. The ball will respawn over the maze if it 
happens to fall off.
